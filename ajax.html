  <h1>API Fun</h1>
  
  <div class = "apidescrip">
    <b>Description of API</b><br>
    The API that I selected was the Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API. This API returns the ID of every single publically
    available object in the museum. This is a large collection, so I filtered the objects to objects that are just a part of department one.
    This was still a large collection of data, so I chose to only display the first 27 available IDs. <br>
    I found it here: https://metmuseum.github.io/
  </div><br>
  
  <div class = "getAPI">
    <b>Options I used for API request</b><br>
    I used a HTTPRequest
      
  </div><br>
  
  <div class = "functions">
    <b>Functionality of this API </b>
    This is a very useful API. The first application of this API is being able to check if a certain art piece is publically available.
    Because each object has a unique ID, you can also use this API to see which department a particular art piece is in.

			str = JSON.stringify(data);
      slicedStr = str.slice(0,100);
      document.getElementById("data").innerHTML = "String of data:<br/>" +  slicedStr +"<br/><br/><br/>";
